#  Unsupervised Clustering Techniques for Historical Greek

This is the repository accompanying the paper *From Orthography to Semantics: Large-Scale Unsupervised Textual Similarity in Historical Greek*, 
which was submitted for the journal 
[Computational Linguistics in the Netherlands (CLIN)](https://www.clinjournal.org). Due to copyright reasons, the full dataset cannot be deployed here, but a small subset of the Database of Byzantine Book Epigrams has been included to allow running the DBBE sections of both  `orthographic_similarity.ipynb` and `semantic_similarity.ipynb`. Replacing this file with a different csv following the same structure, should allow running both scripts against other data.
